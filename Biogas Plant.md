### Prefabricated portable Biogas Plant

With a biogas plant, organic waste and side streams are converted into income by producing renewable energy and organic fertilizer cost-effectively. Produced biogas can be utilized for electricity and heat production. Biogas can be also upgraded to biomethane that can be used as vehicle fuel or fed into the natural gas grid as a substitute for fossil gas.
